## **Introduction**

This is my 5th and final portfolio project at code institute. This project is designed to be an Online Computer Retailer, which allows the customer to buy computer products and components. This project is a computer shop website designed to advertise the shop and to allow the customer to buy products and components. On the website, customers can buy any product as a guest as they don’t need to register to buy any product. But if they want to save their information then they must register. This website has been deployed on Heroku.

## **User Experience**

### **Strategy**
The first step in the design process is to determine what the end user is, and what they should be able to view as well as interact with. I will start with the Strategy - thinking about the target audience for this gallery & the features they would benefit from.

The target audience for 'Computer World' are: - should this not be people e.g. computer enthusiasts, IT professionals?

- Computer Enthusiasts.
- IT Professionals.

These users will be looking for:

- Any product on the website, easy to check detail and purchase.
- All the products price, description, and new product up to date every day.
- User account functionality to view past orders and store billing information.
- Sign up newsletter for see deals, new products everyday.

### **User Stories**

Please find all my defined user stories & their acceptance criteria [here](https://github.com/preetbhullar90/computer-world/issues)

### **1. Sort and Searching products:**

- As a shopper I can sort the list of all the products so that I can easily find the best price, high rate and sorted by product category.
- As a shopper I can sort product by specific categories so that I can sort product by specific category and find best price and best rates.
- As a shopper I can search a product by name or description so that I can easily find a specific product by name which I’d like to purchase.
- As a shopper I can see what I’ve searched for and the number of results so that I can easily decide whether the product I want is available.
